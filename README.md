# IndexedList
Indexed list represented on a singly linked list on array.
Main idea is that a second array is created which links the position of elements in the list.
The array also keeps track of the empty slots, that way we can be most efficient in adding new elements to list.
There is also an iterator to traverse the list with ease.
